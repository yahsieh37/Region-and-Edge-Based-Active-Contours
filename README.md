# Region- and Edge-based Active Contour for Automatic Crack Segmentation Refinement
## Final project for Gatech ECE 6560 - Partial Differential Equations in Image Processing and Computer Vision (Spring 2020)

This project aims at utilizing partial differential equations (PDEs) techniques as a post-processing step to refine the crack segmentation results generated by the deep CNN models. Specifically, a Region- and Edge-based Active Contour (REAC) is developed to refine the crack segmentation masks (S) generated from a FCN with ResNet50 backbone so that predictions closer to the ground-truth (G) can be avhieved.
